  - [X] removeComponent[T](item: (ECS, Entity), c: typedesc[T])
  - [X] add<ComponentName>(item: (ECS, Entity), c: ComponentName)
  - [X] remove<ComponentName>(item: (ECS, Entity))
  - [X] <componentName>(item: (ECS, Entity)): ComponentName
  - [X] removeEntity(item: (ECS, Entity))
  - [X] removeEntity(ecs: ECS, entity: Entity)
  - [X] Keep track of current lowest and highest registered Entity in ECS (optimize loops)
    - [X] Add above optimization to `queryAll()` and `newEntity()`

- [X] Be able to name components in the sys-macro like `(vel: Velocity)`

- [ ] Only export component procedures and templates for a given Component if it is marked with *
