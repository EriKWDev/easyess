## About
First and foremost, if you really want an ECS with great performance
and lots of thought put into it, this is not for you. I instead point
you to the amazing [polymorph](https://github.com/rlipsc/polymorph).

Easyess started as a learning project for myself after having used polymorph
and being amazed by its performance. I had never really gotten into writing
more complicated `macros` and `templates` before, and after having had that
experience I began investigaring them more.

## Documentation
Please do `nimble docgen` to generate HTML documentation.
This is a special task which will include some example
components and systems in order to also show Documentation
for all of the compileTime-generated procs, funcs, templates and macros.
